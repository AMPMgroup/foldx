## FoldX - Predicting changes in protein stability caused by mutation 
### Project: “Characterizing therapeutic antibody interactions”.
#### Task 2: Write a Python code to determine the binding energy changes caused by a certain point mutation at a specific site, such as Ala->Ser. 
FoldX is a software application for molecular modeling and protein design that calculates energy differences that are near to experimental values. FoldX has the ability to reduce a PDB structure, change one or more residues to new residues, analyze protein stability, protein-protein interaction energy, and much more. FoldX is commonly used to anticipate the effect of mutations on a protein's stability or on protein-protein interaction.
